### Body descriptions
While I provide descriptions for default presets, I encourage you to:
- Generate descriptions for your favorite body presets and save them in json file
- Put this file into folder `SKSE\Plugins\BodyLanguage\bodyDescriptions`
- Load your game and you should have this descriptions in LLM prompts
- Share your generated descriptions with others

### TNG descriptions
While I provide descriptions for default TNG addons, I encourage you to:
- If you use TNG addons create your json file, like:
```json
{
    "__metaInfo": {
        "typeName": "JFormMap"
    },
    "__formData|{name of addon plugin fule}|{form of armor addon}": "your addon description"
}
```
- Addon description should fit in sentence like this: `Balgruf's cock is average with a {your addon description} appearance."'`
- Example of TNG's default addons: [SKSE\Plugins\BodyLanguage\tngDescriptions\default.json](./SKSE/Plugins/BodyLanguage/tngDescriptions/default.json)
- Put your newly created json file near `default.json`
- Load your game and you should have this descriptions in LLM prompts
- Share your generated descriptions with others
